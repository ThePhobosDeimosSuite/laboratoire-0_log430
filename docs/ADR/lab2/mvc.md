# MVC

### Context
This app needs a basic console interface allowing the user to send and retrieve data from a **postgreSQL** database.

### Decision
The **MVC** architecture is flexible yet simple, the code is easy to understand and everything can be put in place fairly quickly. There's still the ability to scale up the app in the future in case new features are needed. It's also a very easy architecture to test because the view doesn't really need testing, thus we can focus on testing the controller and model. The projet isn't going to grow very much in the future so we don't need an architecture that could support stuff like networking.

### Status
Accepted

### Consequence
The view will use **terminal-kit** to show and retrieve data from the user. Models will be automatically generated by Prisma and each of the 3 user types will have a dedicated controller to manage data between the view and the model. Everything will be organized into two folders:  
- `/src/view`
- `/src/controller`
