# Technology chosen

### Node.js
*Javascript* is untyped so it's flexible with how it processes data. I think it's useful when creating a small app where you don't really want to pay too much attention to what type a certain field is and instead focus on making the app work.

### Typescript
I still think having types can be useful sometimes, of instance it can be useful when dealing with data coming from the ORM.

### Terminal-kit
I've never used this library before, but from what i've seen on the readme page it seems to be a very versatile tool. Simple tasks like asking the user for input can aslo be done very easily.

### Prisma
I've never worked with this library before, but there seems to be a huge amount of documentation online. I'm also somewhat unfamiliar with ORMs so i just asked *ChatGPT* for the best library for this paticular project.

### Jest
This is what i've always used. It was my first time setting up the environment for Jest and I had a hard time making it work with *ESM*.
