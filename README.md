    ```json
    {
        "data": {
            "name":"Chou",
            "stock": 40,
            "price": 3.99,
            "category": "LÃ©gume"
        }
    }
    ```

    - `?name=Comcombre`
    - `?category=Fruit`
    - `?id=2`

- `/sales` : create, get and update sales. Here's an example on how to create a sale: 
    ```json
    POST /sales
    {
        "data":
            [
                {
                    "productId": 1,
                    "amount" : 3
                },
                {
                    "productId": 3,
                    "amount" : 1
                }
            ]
    }
    ```
    A sale can also be cancelled as such : 
    ```json
    POST /sales/:id
    {
        "data": 
        {
            "isCancelled":true
        }
    }
    ```
